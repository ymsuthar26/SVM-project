# SVM-project
This project demonstrates how to use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for binary classification using the popular `scikit-learn` library. It includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and performance evaluation.

## Contents
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Model training with SVM
- Confusion matrix and accuracy score

## Tools
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Output
The model performance is evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix visualization.
